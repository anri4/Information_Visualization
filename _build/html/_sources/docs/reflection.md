# Reflection

Peer feedback

In the final weeks of our project our team gathered with other groups for peer feedback, where one group presented the work they had done. After the presentation, the two other groups gave feedback on what has been done well, as well as things to improve on.


Below is a list of the feedback provided from the other groups as well as the TA:

- Comparing the maps was not easy.
- Instead of unemplyoment we could look at open vacancies.
- Using 2018 as a cut-off data so all graphs have the same end date.
- Combine the two world maps in one with one slider.
- Adding scientific sources where necessary


We took this feedback seriously and made several improvements to our project.
Self-reflection
Throughout this project, we learned valuable lessons about teamwork, data analysis, and the complexities of economic policy discussions.
As a team, we learned the importance of clear communication and working as a team The peer feedback sessions were helpfull in helping us identify areas for improvement and making our final project more clean and impactful. This experience has not only enhanced our technical and analytical skills but also our ability to work effectively as a team.
