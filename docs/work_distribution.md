# Work distribution
We established a clear communication plan that included bi-weekly meetings(twice a week) at Science Park and daily check-ins via a messaging app if when necessary.  This ensured that everyone was on the same page and that tasks were completed in a timely manner. We also created shared documents and repositories for our data, code, and reports, allowing for easy access and collaborative editing.

We approached the project in several stages:

- Planning and Research: Defined the project scope, identified key questions, and gathered relevant data.
- Data Analysis and Visualization: Conducted data analysis and created visualizations to illustrate key findings.
- Report Writing and adding final touch: Compiled the analysis into a comprehensive report

We all worked together on all aspects of the project, thus we did not have seperate roles for the team members. However, some team members did have specific roles that they focused on more than others.

- Anri - Technical lead:
     Took the lead in setting up the jupyterbook enviroment and helped other team members with their technical difficulties.

- Tijger - Research and Coordination Lead:
      Helped in finding datasets that fit the subject and cleaned and merged the datasets for further analysis
        
- Riko - Visualization and communication:
       Took charge of the visualization of plots, ensuring that the data was presented in a clear and impactful manner.
