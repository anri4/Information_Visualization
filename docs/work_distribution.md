# Work distribution
At the outset of the project, we established a clear communication plan that included weekly video meetings and daily check-ins via a messaging app. We used a project management tool to assign tasks, track progress, and set deadlines. This ensured that everyone was on the same page and that tasks were completed in a timely manner. We also created shared documents and repositories for our data, code, and reports, allowing for easy access and collaborative editing.

We approached the project in several stages:

- Planning and Research: Defined the project scope, identified key questions, and gathered relevant data.
- Data Analysis and Visualization: Conducted data analysis and created visualizations to illustrate key findings.
- Report Writing and adding final touch: Compiled the analysis into a comprehensive report

We all worked together on all aspects of the project, thus we did not have seperate roles for the team members.

- Anri - Technical lead:
     Took the lead in setting up the jupyterbook enviroment and helped other team members with their technical difficulties.

- Tijger - Research and Coordination Lead:
      Helped in finding datasets that fit the subject and cleaned and merged the datasets for further analysis
        
- Riko - Visualization and communication:
       Took charge of the visualization of plots, ensuring that the data was presented in a clear and impactful manner.
